Welcome to the Soyle Stories User Manual. 

This manual is intended to give users a guide to using the Soyle Stories software. The Soyle Stories open-source software gives writers the tools to compile the facts of their stories, write out scenes linked with characters, locations, and other story elements, disocver plot holes, track character development over time, and much more.
The guide is sectioned by questions a user might ask when using the software. How do I create a character? How do I track the events in my story? What is the Character Comparison tool?
We hope to build this manual to provide all the answers a user might ask to help them use the program in the best way and make their stories better, from start to finish. 
To navigate the guide, search for questions that arise while using the software. E.g., "What can I do with the Scenes List Tool?" The page with your question will demostrate the uses of different features with examples, and demonstrate step by step how a user might complete their goal.
Soyle Stories is an open-source program made by a community that loves stories and loves to write them, and what drives us is the passion to create tools to give writers help to make the stories the best they can be.

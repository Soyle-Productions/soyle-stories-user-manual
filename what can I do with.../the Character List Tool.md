# What can I do with the Character List Tool?

The Character List shows all the [characters](/What%20is.../a%20Character.md) in your project and allows you to manage them.

You can:

- create a character
- create a character arc 
- create a character name variant
- delete a character 
- rename a character
- view a character profile

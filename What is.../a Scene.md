# Scene

A scene encompasses one or more story events. In a written story, a scene would be told to the reader as prose; but in a movie, or other forms of storytelling, it may be told via a written script, then later as something filmed, animated, or performed. A scene can have inciting characters and oppositions to the inciting character.

### Typical properties of a scene include:

- Name

- Character Opposition to the Inciting Character with Desire, Motivation, and Character Arc section in the scene

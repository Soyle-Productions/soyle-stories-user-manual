# Theme

A Theme is a central question within the story that the story explores and will (sometimes) attempt to answer.

### Typical properties of a theme include:

- The central question
- The central conflict (what are the characters fighting over that forces them into being confronted with this question)
- (Possibly) a theme line that is the author's answer to the question
- Major Characters
- Minor Characters
- Symbols
- Values in Conflict

### Things That can be Done with or to a Theme:

- Add or Remove Characters to/from it
- Create a Symbol in it

 # Character Perspective

A Character Perspective is the one or more Story Functions that each Character in a Theme serves. A character can only serve one of each Story Function (e.g., a character cannot be an Antognist twice). Antagonistic characters have a spectial way of attacking the perspective Character's weakness.


### Typical properties of a character perspective include:

- Character assigned
- Conflict and change with other Perspectives
- Story function
- Theme
- Moral Argument of a Character, including a Moral Problem, Theme Line, and Thematic Revelation

### Things that can be done with or to a Character Perspective:

- Add or Remove Characters 
- Conflict and challenge other perspectives
- Set story function
- Set theme
- Set moral argument

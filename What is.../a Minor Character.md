# Minor Character

A Minor Character can be a character assigned to a Theme who pushes a Major Character along a Theme and who does not have a perspective in that theme. A distinction between major and minor characters within a theme are that minor characters only exist to push the major characters along that theme. They themselves are not pushed. 

### Exmaples
Most movies will only have the protagonist be a major character while everyone else is a minor character.  If there is another major character, it's usually the antagonist because the protagonist is able to challenge them. In the same, larger story, someone who is typically a major character within the themes of the story can still be a minor character in a theme that focuses on something non-centric to their character.  They typically wouldn't have a perspective within that episode (if we're talking about TV). For example, if a theme line of Lord of the Rings is that good, ordinary folk can conquer overwhelming evil if they resist temptation and suffering, then the Ring Wraiths can be minor characters which push the major characters like Frodo and Sam along that theme. 

### Typical properties of a minor character include:

- Theme
- Way They Push A Major Character on that Theme

### Things That can be Done with or to a Minor Character:

- Assign or Unassign Characters to/from it
- Promote a minor character to a major character.

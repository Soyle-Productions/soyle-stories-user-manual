# How do I remove a location from my project?

If you no longer want a location in your project and want to completely remove it, follow the steps below. This is different from removing a location from a scene, which does not remove it from the project.

## To remove a location from your project, assuming you've created the location:

1. Assuming you have the [Location List Tool] open
2. Right-click the location
3.  Confirm the deletion in the pop-up dialogue
4. Select "Delete" from the menu

The location is now removed from the project.

# How do I remove a character from my scene?

Removing a [character](/What%20is/a%20Character.md) from your [scene](/What%20is/a%20Scene.md) will take them out of the scene in question, but the character will not be removed from your [project](/What%20is/a%20Project.md).

## To remove a character from your scene, assuming you've included the character in the scene:

1. Assuming you have the [Scene List Tool](/What%20can%20I%20do%20with/the%20Scene%20List%20Tool.md) open
2. Right-click the scene
3. Select "Track Character" in the drop down menu to open the Scene Characters tool
4. Right-click the character in the Scene Characters tool
5. Select "Remove from Scene" in the dropdown menu

The character is now removed from the scene.

# How do I remove a character's alas?
A character [alias](/How%20do%20I%20create/a%20character%20name%20variant.md) is one or more alternative names you can create to refer to your [character](/What%20is/a%20Character.md), viewable in the [character's profile](/How%20do%20I/view/a%20character%20profile.md), and can be easily removed. An alias can be nicknames, professional titles, secret identities, etc. 

## To remove a character's name variation, assuming you have a character with a name variation:

1. Assuming you have the [Character List Tool](/What%20can%20I%20do%20with/the%20Character%20List%20Tool.md) open
2. Right-click the character 
3. Select [View Profile](/How%20I%20v)
4. Find the name variant you want to delete in the ALSO KNOWN AS section
5. Click the trash icon to remove the name variant

The character's alias is now removed from the character's profile.

# How do I remove a character from my project?

Removing your [character](/What%20is/a%20Character.md) from your [project](/What%20is/a%20Project.md) will remove that character all together from your project file. This is different from removing a character from a scene, for example. 

## There are two ways to remove a character from your project, assuming you've created the character:

1. Assuming you have the [Character List Tool](/What%20can%20I%20do%20with/the%20Character%20List%20Tool.md) open
2. Right-click the character
3.  Confirm the deletion in the dialogue popup
4. Select "Delete" from the drop-down

OR

1. Assuming you have the Character List Tool open
2. Click on the character
3. Click the "Options" button at the top
4. Confirm the deletion in the dialogue popup
5. Select "Delete" from the dropdown

The character is now removed from the project.

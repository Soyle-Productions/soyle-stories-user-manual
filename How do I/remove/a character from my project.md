# How do I remove a character from my project?

Removing your [character](/What%20is/a%20Character.md) from your [project](/What%20is/a%20Project.md) will remove that character from your project file. This is different from [removing a character from a scene](/How%20do%20I%20remove/a%20character%20from%my%20scene.md), for example. 

## There are two ways to remove a character from your project, assuming you've created the character:

1. Assuming you have the [Character List Tool](/What%20can%20I%20do%20with/the%20Character%20List%20Tool.md) open
2. Right-click the character
3. Select "Delete" from the menu
4. Confirm the deletion in the pop-up dialogue

The character is now removed from the project.

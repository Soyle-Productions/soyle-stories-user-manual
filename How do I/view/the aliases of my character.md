# How do I view the aliases of my character?

A character profile is where you can view a character's alias after you [create one or more alias for your character](/How%20do%20I/create/a%20character%20alias.md).

## To view a character's profile, assuming you've created a character and given them an alias: 

1. Assuming you have the [Character List Tool open](/What%20can%20I%20do%20with/the%20Character%20List%20Tool.md)
2. Right-click the character in the Character List Tool
3. Select "View Profile"

You should see the list of character aliases in the ALSO KNOWN AS section of the character profile.

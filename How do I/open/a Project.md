# How do I open my saved project?

If you've already created a [project](/What%20is/a%20Project.md) and saved it in an earlier session, you can pull it back up from the folder where you saved your story file. 

## There are two ways to open a project, assuming you have one saved:

From the Welcome screen:

1. Assuming you have Soyle Stories open
2. Select Open project
3. Find the project in the folder where you saved it last

From inside the program:

1. Click "File" in the top toolbar
2. TBD

Your project will be open and ready to edit.

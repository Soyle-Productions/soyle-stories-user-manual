# How do I host a location in a scene?

Hosting a [location](/What%20is/a%20Location.md) is a [scene](/What%20is/a%20Scene.md) makes that location a setting within the scene.

## To host a location in a scene, assuming you've created a scene and a location:

1. Assuming you have the [Scene List Tool](/What%20can%20I%20do%20with/the%20Scene%20List%20Tool.md) open
2. Right-click the scene you want to host a location
3. Select "Track Locations" in the dropdown menu, and the [Scene Settings Tool](/What%20can%20I%20do%20with/the%20Scene%20Settings%20Tool.md) will open
4. In the Scene Settings Tool, click "Use Location" button at the bottom
5. From the dropdown menu, select the location you want to be hosted in the scene
6. The location will now be hosted in the scene as shown in the Scene Settings Tool

Your location will now appear in the Scene Settings.

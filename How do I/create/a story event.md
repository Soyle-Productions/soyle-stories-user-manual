# How do I create a story event?

A story event is something that takes place in your story with a [location](/What%20is/a%20Location.md) and/or [character(s)](/What%20is/a%20Character.md).

## To create a story event in the Story Event List tool:

1. Assuming you have a [Project](/What%20is/a%20Project.md) open
2. Select the [Story Event List tool](/What%20can%20I%20do%20with/the%20Story%20Event%20List.md)
3. Click the "Create Story Event" button
4. Supply a Name and an optional time unit
5. Click the "Create" button

Your new story event should now appear in the Story Event List Tool.

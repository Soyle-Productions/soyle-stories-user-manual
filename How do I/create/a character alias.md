# How do I create an alias for my character?

A character alias is one or more alternative names you can create to refer to your [character](/What%20is/a%20Character.md), viewable in the [character's profile](/How%20do%20I/view/the%20aliases%20of%20my%20character.md), and can be easily removed. An alias can be nicknames, professional titles, secret identities, etc. 

## To create a name variant after you've created a character:

1. Assuming you have the [Character List Tool](/What%20can%20I%20do%20with/the%20Character%20List%20Tool.md) open
2. Right-click on the character
3. Select "View Profile" to open the character's profile
4. Click on ALSO KNOWN AS 
5. Type in the alias
6. Hit Enter 

You character's alias should now appear in the ALSO KNOWN AS section of their character profile.

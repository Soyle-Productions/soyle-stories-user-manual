# How do I create a scene?

A scene describes one or more [story events](/What%20is/a%20Story%20Event.md) that take place in your story, and can include [characters](/What%20is/a%20Character.md) and [locations](/What%20is/a%20Location.md).


## Create a scene in the Scene List tool:

1. Assuming you have a [Project](/What%20is/a%20Project.md) open
2. /BROKEN LINK/ Select the [Scene List tool](/What%20can%20I%20do%20with/the%20Scene%20List%20Tool.md)
3. Click the "Create New Scene" button
4. Supply a Name
5. Hit the Enter key

Your new scene should now appear in the Scene List Tool.

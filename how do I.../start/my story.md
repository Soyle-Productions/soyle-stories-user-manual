# How do I start my story in Soyle Stories?

To start editing your story in the Soyle Stories software, you'll need to begin by creating a project. 

Make sure you have the  .exe file of Soyle Stories downloaded from our website. Once you have the software on your computer, open up Soyle Stories. After the splash screen, you will see the Soyle Stories logo, and two options to Create New Project and Open Project.

Select "Create New Project." In the Directory screen, you can choose where to save your project to access to it later, and you will be able to name your project. The title of your story or a version of the title of your story is a good example of a project title. After you've selected a Directory folder and Project Name, select "Create Project."

Once a project is created, there are many different ways to start putting in the details of your story, such as:

- Create your characters
- Create your scenes
- Write your first scene in the Scene Editor

There is no wrong way to use the software to start your story. The best approach is to play around with the software, putting in the details of your story, and seeing how the program works, consulting the guide when you run into a wall trying to figure out how to do something with the software.

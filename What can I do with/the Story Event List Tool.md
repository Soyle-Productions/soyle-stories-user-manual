# What can I do with the Story Events List Tool?

The Story Event List shows all the [story events](/What%20is.../a%20Story%20Event.md) in your project and allows you to manage them.

You can
- [create a story event](/How%20do%20I/create/a%20story%20event.md)
- [rename story events](/How%20do%20I/rename/a%20story%20event.md)
- [delete story events](/How%20do%20I/remove/a%20story%20event.md)
- reschedule one
- adjust the times of many.

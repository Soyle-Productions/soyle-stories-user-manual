# What can I do with the Character List Tool?

The Character List shows all the [characters](/What%20is/a%20Character.md) in your project and allows you to manage them.

## You can:

- [create a character](/How%20do%20I/create/a%20character.md)
- [create a character name variant](/How%20do%20I/create/a%20character%20name%20variant.md)
- [remove a character from your project](/How%20do%20I/remove/a%20character%20from%20my%20project.md) 
- rename a character
- view a character profile

A time skip is a duration of time spanning at least 3 [units of time](/What%20is/a%20Unit%20of%20Time.md) during which nothing of importance happens within the story.  It allows a writer to quickly move to a [story event](/What%20is/a%20Story%20Event.md) that is in the distant future.

A time skip has
- a duration at least 3 [units of time](/What%20is/a%20Unit%20of%20Time.md) long
- a starting point in time relative to the start of the story

Time Skips can be
- [created](/How%20Do%20I/Create/a%20Time%20Skip.md) or [removed](/How%20Do%20I/Remove/a%20Time%20Skip.md), but only if there are no story events that take place during the spanned time.  The time span must be at least 3 [units of time](/What%20is/a%20Unit%20of%20Time.md) long in order to be of any benefit.
- [adjusted](/How%20Do%20I/Change/a%20Time%20Skip's%20Duration.md) to cover more or less time.
- [moved](/How%20Do%20I/Move/a%20Time%20Skip%20Through%20Time.md) to cover the same duration, but starting at a different point in time.

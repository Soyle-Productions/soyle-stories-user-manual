A Story Event is a distinct change within the story world.  It may or may not be shown to the audience or reader, but it's something that has happened at some point.  Typically, a story event will have:
- a name
- a summary
- maybe one or more characters
- maybe a location in which it takes place
- a time unit at which it happens

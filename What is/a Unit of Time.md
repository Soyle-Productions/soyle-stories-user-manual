#### A Unit of Time is simply a number since the start of a story's timeline.  The writer can interpret it as any unit of time that makes sense to them based on the time scales they want to work with.

### Units of Time can be

- or [removed](/How%20Do%20I/Remove/Time%20Between%20Story%20Events.md), but only if there are no story events that take place during that unit of time.
